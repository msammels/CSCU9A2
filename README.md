### CSCU9A2

The code within this repository is designed and developed in line with the
practicals for the first year course at the University of Stirling.

## Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed:

- The Java SDK
  - This can be either Oracle or OpenJDK of at least version 8.0
- A suitable IDE
  - The files in this repository where created using
  [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), but any suitable
  editor will work.

## Compiling
As stated earlier, the code was created using my favourite editor, but I have
removed all of the files that the editor generated, leaving just the base
files.

The code here does not use any external libraries such as JUnit, nor does it
require Maven or Gradle to run, so you can use your favourite editor without
issue to run the code.

## Folder Layout
You will notice that this does not use the standard folder structure, as
normally found:

    /src/com/msammels/project/main/src/File.Java
    /src/com/msammels/project/test/src/File.java

But instead uses the following folder structure:

    /Week #/project/src/File.Java

The reason for this is because during the first year at University, we were
not expected to known the complete understanding of how a project was laid
out, but more exactly how the code functioned and to make things work
properly.

However, unlike [CSCU9A1](https://github.com/msammels/CSCU9A1), there are
now src folders located within each week.

You should be able to move things into whatever folder structure you feel
most appropriate and things should still work OK. If you are using the same
editor as myself you will need to make sure that each folder is located
within it's own module (so to avoid conflicts) or make each one a separate
project. I cannot comment on other editors.

## Assignment Folder
Because this is the second semester of the first year, we were expected to
create a program in Java. You will find this within the Assignment folder.
